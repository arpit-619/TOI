                <h3>WHAT IS THE ‘THINK OF IT’ – YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM?</h3>
                    <p>
                    YLP exists for the youth to act in unison with an aim to create an impact by addressing social,
                    political, and environmental issues. It makes them; the youth realize the significance of a
                    youth-led nation.

                    They need to lead life by their inherent nature; not by the conventional means, which this program
                    supports and remains at disposal for. It’s rather easy to rely upon secondary sources such as
                    newspapers and news channels to keep a tab on everything happening around the globe however gone are
                    the days when these sources were devoid of bias and prejudice. It’s time for the youth to organize
                    themselves amidst this cut-throat quest for truth which is never easy to discover let alone
                    expressed in coherent terms. The program blends learning with leadership and fun, aiming at the
                    wholesome development of the most important and energetic cluster of our society – the youth!

                    To answer the ‘What’ behind this program’s existence would be to usher the youth to, in very
                    straightforward terms, ‘Think of It’ i.e. the ongoing issues pertaining to multifarious spheres,
                    morality, ideals, the sense of justice that prevails and to conjecture upon ideas that should be
                    prevailing instead. Youth and leadership share an intrinsic yet undervalued relationship, we are
                    here to bridge the gap between the two and provide a platform to equip the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
